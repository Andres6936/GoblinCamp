## About

Goblin Camp aims to be a roguelike city builder with an emphasis on
macromanaging the economy and military. I've drawn inspiration from games
such as Anno 1404, Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper.

Goblins camp is Dwarf Fortress-like game.

### Status Quo

The code have been abandoned some years ago, but you can still build and run it in in Debian Wheezy
chroot container. See [BUILD.using_cmake.md](BUILD.using_cmake.md) for building guide
