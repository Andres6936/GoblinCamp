Boost.Build-powered build system for Goblin Camp.

It's far from being perfect (and for now not self-contained, although I'll keep trying),
but should work in most cases.

Before you build GC:
1. Prepare deps/Jamfile.jam by copying proper deps/Jamfile.jam.<toolset>, and maybe editing it to suit
   your environment.
2. If you don't have bjam, run boost-build/jam_src/build.bat (or build.sh).

To build GC, navigate to the root directory (one with Jamroot.jam), and run `bjam install` â€” this will
build GC and copy almost everything needed to run it into build/dist/debug.

To build release version, use `bjam variant=release-pdb install`.
